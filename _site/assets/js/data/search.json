    "content": "This article originates from a coursework conducted at the University of Bristol, focusing on the fabrication and investigation of a Pneu-Net soft gripper architecture. The following video provides an overview of the operational principles of this type of gripper.  The soft gripper in actionIntroduction : a quick literature review on fluidic elastomer grippersGrippers are essential for robots to interact with and manipulateobjects in their environment. In industrial applications, traditionalgrippers consist of rigid links and joints that deform to grip anobject. However, their structural and kinematic complexity can makecontrol challenging. This report focuses on a less complex alternative:fluidic elastomer grippers. The latter are composed of an elastomer structure with an internalnetwork of fluidic channels. The injection of pressurised fluid insidethese channels can deform the gripper’s structure, and manage itsopening and closing. The soft nature of the gripper allows it to graspfragile objects delicately. This characteristic has been tested inapplications such as coral sampling in the deep sea  (Galloway et al., 2016). Actuatorsof this type can be controlled using various fluids, but the air ispreferred due to its low viscosity. This characteristic allows lowerpressure forces to be exerted within the gripper (Marchese et al., 2015).The most commonly used manufacturing method for fluidic elastomergrippers is castable silicone moulded into 3D printed parts. The mouldallows the generation of silicon sections of different stiffnessesallowing the deformation of the gripper when it is being pressurised. 3Dprinting to produce these moulds offers numerous advantages, such asreduced manufacturing costs, rapid prototyping, and repeatability(Marchese et al., 2015; Mosadegh et al., 2014). The scaffold-removalmethod, in which internal structures are added to the elastomer andlater dissolved, can create complex shapes that cannot be achieved withthe previously mentioned technique (Saggiomo &amp; Velders, 2015).The most commonly used channel architecture in soft robotics is thePneu-Net architecture, which consists of two parts, as shown in Fig.1. The firstpart is designed to be expandable and contains the desired channelstructure and expansion chambers. The second part is reinforced with anon-expandable material, such as fabric or fibres.{#Pneu-Net}Fig. 1 Pneu-Net Architecture - Illustation from (Mosadegh et al., 2014)When pressurised, the first part expands, stretching the walls of thechambers in the expandable section. This deformation causes the entireactuator to flex (Marchese et al., 2015; Ilievski et al., 2011).Different manufacturing methods and architectures were also explored.Wang et al. were able to develop a 3-fingered gripper composed entirelyof 3D-printed parts (Wang &amp; Hirai, 2017). Yang et al. contributed by using thecontraction principle to operate a gripper’s opening and closing. Theirmethod is to apply negative pressure in a solid molded with siliconethat contains cavities. Under the pressure, the cavities retract anddeform the material. The solid is then equipped with extensions that actas fingers. The contraction and relaxation of the material allows themodification of the space between the extensions, thus allowing theopening and closing of the gripper (Yang et al., 2015). The article (Zhou et al., 2022) presents a gripper composed of several prestrained fluid composite actuators. Each actuator uses a restraining layer made of composite to obtain a pre-curved equilibrium shape. The other layers made of elastomers flatten the composite part when pressure is introduced into the actuator. Unlike previously presented technologies, this method has the advantage that the system’s equilibrium position corresponds to the closed gripper position.The literature includes several studies proposing various methods to improve the efficiency and intelligence of fluidic elastomer grippers. For instance, Glick et al. used biomimicry to enhance gripping performance by creating a gripper consisting of two Pneu-Net actuators coated with a gecko-inspired adhesive. This approach enabled the gripper to improve its grasping abilities (Glick et al., 2018). The manufacturing process of grippers also allows for the direct integration of sensors into the gripper structure to make them intelligent. For instance, in (Wang &amp; Hirai, 2016), curvature sensors were integrated into each finger of a gripper to evaluate their curvature during object grasping. Similarly, (Yang et al., 2020) integrated resistive deformation sensors and capacitive proximity sensors into a Pneu-Net gripper to enable it to detect the size of the grasped objects. Yang et al. have successfully developed a 3D printed pneumatic actuator inspired by the kinematics of the human finger. The actuator can be printed in one piece and contains pressure and position sensors integrated at each joint. This innovation opens up possibilities for applications requiring closed-loop control (Yang &amp; Chen, 2017).Gripper FabricationThe gripper design, provided by the University of Bristol, features thePneu-Net architecture, which consists of 8 chambers located on eitherside of the air supply. The gripper’s inextensible layer is mainly madeof J-cloth fabric, while its extensible layer is made of Eco Flex00-30silicone material (Company, 2019). It should be noted that the mechanicalproperties of J-Cloth are anisotropic : it can stretch more easily inone direction than another.Materials providedTo fabricate the gripper, the University of Bristol provides a kit thatcontains the following elements:      Ecoflex 00-30 (Composed of two liquids (A and B) to be mixedtogether to obtain silicone.)        Nitrile rubber gloves, Blue paper (for cleaning)        Mixing sticks and a Mixing pot        A 3D printed mould (Shown in Fig.2)        Syringe, a connector and tubing        J-cloth (A type of absorbent fabric whose initial application isfound in the household domain)              Fig. 2 CAD model of the 3D printed mouldSafety conditionsEven though both components used in the silicone fabrication process arenot skin irritants, as a preventive measure, all handling involvingliquid Ecoflex will be carried out with nitrile gloves.Fabrication processAll the instructions for making the gripper are provided in a video madeby Dr. Alix Partridge. The instructions can be summarized in thefollowing three steps:      Silicone Fabrication Process : To make silicone, the same processwill always be used: mix each EcoFlex component in equal proportionsin a mixing pot, then pour the resulting mixture into a syringe. Byplugging the end of the syringe, and pulling the plunger, it ispossible to create vacuum. This will eliminate air bubbles in theliquid. This process should be repeated at least 10 times.        First step : To start, cut a piece of J-cloth slightly larger thanthe mould surface and place it on a smooth surface, like laminatedcardboard. Ensure that the direction in which the J-tissue canstretch is aligned with the longitudinal axis of the mould. Also besure to position a piece of tube at the designated location in thecentre of the mould. Then make silicone using the method describedabove. Pour the silicone into the mould being careful not tointroduce air bubbles. The remaining silicone can be applied to theJ-Cloth using the supplied mixing sticks. Let the silicone dry for aminimum of 4 hours.        Second step : To start, demold the silicone and peel off theJ-Cloth from the smooth surface. Then, cover the base of the moldedpart with a thin layer of liquid silicone using your finger. Coatthe surface of the J-Cloth that was in contact with theplastic-coated cardboard with silicone as well. Next, place the twocoated layers in contact, taking care to avoid the formation of airbubbles at the joint. After completing this step, it is important toallow the silicone to dry for 4 hours.        Third step : Connect the gripper tube to the syringe using theadapter, pressurize it and check for proper functioning  Experimental designIn the framework of this project, two main experiments are envisioned:the first one focuses on studying the curvature of the gripper as afunction of the injected air volume, and the second one aims todetermine the gripper’s performance in grasping multiple types ofobjects.Curvature StudyHypothesisBy compressing the gripper with different volumes, it is observed thatthe curvature of the gripper appears to approach that of a circular arc.To experimentally test this hypothesis, a measurement method isestablished to record the gripper’s curvature using a camera. A circularfitting method will be used to verify if the curvature of the grippercan be inscribed in a circle. If this hypothesis is validated throughthe experiment, it will also be possible to plot the gripper clampingradius evolution law as a function of the injected air volume.[]{#part:hypothese label=”part:hypothese”}Setting up the test benchFor precise measurements, a test bench is utilized to hold the gripperfixed during compression. This setup ensures a constant fixed positionof the camera and gripper for all tested air volumes. The test bench, asshown in Fig. 3, also includes a graduated ruler that serves asa scale during machine vision analysis. A black background is placed toaid the machine vision procedure, and red pinheads are evenlydistributed along the gripper for subsequent identification of itscurvature (Fig. 3). The machine vision technique employed iselaborated in a following sectionProposed experimental protocolThe following method is used for each volume from 0 to 60 ml with a stepof 5 ml:      The considered volume is injected into the gripper and a paper clipis used to clamp the tube and keep the gripper in a fixed position.        A scene acquisition is performed using a camera, which is asmartphone held on a tripod.        The coordinates of the gripper pinheads are extracted using amachine vision algorithm, which provides pixel coordinates in theimage reference frame.        The circle-fit library (“Circle-Fit - A Circle Fitting Library for Python,” n.d.) is used to determine the parametersof the circle (center coordinates and radius) that best fits all thegripper points. The accuracy and precision of the model areevaluated using the value of the residual error provided by thelibrary. The results obtained are returned in pixels, the scalepresent on the photo allows to convert the found values intocentimeters.        The gripper markers and the fitting circle are displayed on the samegraph.  First, these data will allow us to study the evolution of the residualerror according to the injected air volume, in order to check if thegripper curvature can be approximated by a circle.Description of the machine vision method usedThe method used is based on the elements provided in the document(Qi &amp; Conn, 2023). For each image to be processed, the same method isapplied. The different functions used come from the Python module OpenCVwhich allows image processing (Bradski, 2000). The coordinates of thegripper points are stored in a list and are subsequently used forinterpretations. The steps of the machine vision algorithm are describedin Fig. 3.            Fig. 3 Test Bench made of LegosThe entire code used in this project is available in the dedicatedGithub repository which can be foundhere.Study of the grasping capability of the soft gripperHypothesisAn assumption is made that the gripper is capable of lifting a widerange of differently shaped objects. The following experiment aims totest the gripper’s ability to lift various types of objects.Proposed experimental protocolThe objective of this experiment is to study the configuration andgrasping capability of the gripper on various everyday objects. Theexperimental protocol involves the following steps:      Select an object and measure its mass.        Place the object on a flat surface.        Position the gripper on the object and compress the syringe.        Attempt to lift the object while taking a photograph of theconfiguration.  Results and AnalysisCurvature StudyMachine Vision ResultsThe machine vision method is applied and allows obtaining the gripper’sshape for different volumes as presented in Fig.4. For display convenience, only half ofthe tested volumes are shown.        Fig.4 Gripper gaitsIt is possible to observe that when the volume is zero (the gripper isnot compressed), it is already curved due to the effect of gravity onthe soft material.Circular fitting results and interpretationsUsing the different coordinates of the points, a circular fitting isperformed for each volume value. Fig.5 shows 4 examples of circular fitting.        Fig.5 Circular Fitting²As the quantity of injected air increases, fitting a circle to thecurvature of the gripper becomes more difficult. This is supported bythe residual error curve (Fig.6), which represents the root mean squareerror between data points and the circumference of the regression circle(“Circle-Fit - A Circle Fitting Library for Python,” n.d.). The gripper’s curvature can be approximated by a circular arcfrom 0 to 25 ml, with a residual error below 1 mm. However, the residualerror increases beyond 30 ml, indicating that the curvature cannot beapproximated by a circular arc. Thus, presenting the clamping radius asa function of the gripper is not relevant from 0 to 60 ml. Thehypothesis stated in sectionThe hypothesis part is not validated.        Fig.6 Residual error as a function of injectedvolumeStudy of another parameterIt is not possible to accurately represent the entire curvature of thegripper using a circular arc. However, an appropriate parameter is beingsought to quantify this curvature. Therefore, the concept of the\"corrected clamping radius\" is introduced, which corresponds to theradius of the circle passing through the center and the gripper ends asshown in Fig. 7. This parameter indirectly quantifies thesize of objects that the gripper can grasp. Finding a model to representthe evolution of this parameter is relevant as it could serve as acontrol law in a more intricate system.        Fig.7 Definition of the Corrected clampingradiusThus, the circular fitting method is applied to only 3 points. Given thenumber of points considered, circular fitting is perfect, and for eachvolume value, the corrected clamping radius is derived. The resultinggraph is presented in Figure8.        Fig.8 Evolution of corrected clampingradiusThe experimental points obtained allow a modeling of the correctedclamping radius (CCR) as a function of the volume. A polynomialregression is applied to the data, and it turns out that a 5th orderregression yields the best correlation coefficient without overfitting.The derived equation is shown inFig.8.Study of the grasping capability of the soft gripperBy using the experimental protocol mentioned, thegripper lifted the different objects presented in Fig.9: a cardboard box,a 3D printed piece, a Rubik’s Cube, and a meter.The gripper was found to be able to grasp a range of objects as long astheir weight is less than 120g. Beyond this threshold, the gripperslides and is unable to hold the object. In addition, the shape of thegripper does not match that of the object it grabs: only the two endsare in contact.To improve the performance of the gripper, it could be considered to adda rough surface like sandpaper to ensure better adhesion, similar to thework done by (Glick et al., 2018).        Fig.9 Various tested objectsradiusDiscussionImprovement suggestions on the fabrication methodTubing problemDuring the manufacturing process, a difficulty arose during thedemolding stage, resulting in the tube being held in the mold anddetachment from the silicone part, as shown in Fig.10{reference-type=”ref” reference=”fig:probleme”}. Iattempted to remedy the situation by using glue to reattach the tube,but the physical properties of the silicone hindered the adhesion of theglue, rendering this solution ineffective.        Fig.10 Fabrication problem encounteredTo address the difficulty at hand, the manufacturing process of themolded part had to be restarted with various precautions taken. Abrasivepaper was utilized to sand the outer surface of the tube for bettersilicone adhesion, and the part of the mold that held the tube was alsosanded to make detachment easier. Once the tube was properly positionedin the mold, the tube base was degreased with 90% alcohol. With thesemeasures in place, the molded part of the gripper was successfullymanufactured without any detachment issues.Air leakage issuesDuring the manufacturing process, another issue was observed whichconcerned air leakage during the final gripper testing. These leaks werefound at the junction between the J-Cloth and the molded part. Anadditional step was added to the process to overcome this issue. At theend of the second step of the manufacturing process, a silicone sealant is applied all around themolded part to prevent leakage. The sealant is depicted in yellow inFig. 11.        Fig.11 Addition of a seal to ensure tightness.Suggestion for design improvementThe current gripper could only limit two degrees of freedom during thegrasping experiment due to its two contact points. To improve this, afeasible solution would be to add a new part to the gripper that blocksall three degrees of freedom, enhancing grasping quality and preventingobject movement on all axes. Increasing the contact surface between thegripper and the object by adding a third contact point would alsoimprove grip. To achieve this, we modified the existing gripper’s CADmodel, creating a three-fingered gripper with 120-degree spacing betweeneach finger. The resulting 3D model was then printed (Fig.12).        Fig.12 Gripper design proposalA silicone shortage prevented full fabrication of the designed gripperfor performance testing and validation of previous hypotheses. Toaddress this, an extension of this work could involve repeating thegrasping experiment using the new gripper design and quantifyingperformance differences between the original and new designs.ConclusionThis project allowed for the discovery of theoretical and practicalconcepts related to fluidic elastomer grippers, with a focus on thePneu-Net architecture. The curvature of the gripper during compressioncan only be considered as an arc of a circle in the volume range of 0 to25 milliliters. By introducing the parameter of corrected clampingradius, it was possible to establish a polynomial relationship betweenthis parameter and the injected air volume. It should be noted that thelaw modeled is specific to the gripper fabricated in this report.Indeed, variations in fabrication can modify the curvature behavior ofthe gripper. The gripping capacity of the gripper was also investigated,demonstrating its ability to grasp various objects of different shapesand masses. Finally, design and manufacturing improvements were proposedfor the gripper.Ilievski, F., Mazzeo, A. D., Shepherd, R. F., Chen, X., &amp; Whitesides, G. M. (2011). Soft robotics for chemists.
