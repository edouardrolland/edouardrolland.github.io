Earth Observation data support the large-scale monitoring of croplands across South America (SA). For instance, optical remote sensing (ORS) data are typically used to map and monitor plant development during a crop season. However, the monitoring of agricultural areas is highly affected by cloud cover frequency (CCF), especially in the rainy season, and the implications of cloud cover for ORS of agricultural areas are still poorly understood in SA. In this study we evaluated the monthly CCF and variability focused on implications for agricultural monitoring in SA. Cloud cover was derived from daily MCD19A2 Collection 6 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product between 2000 and 2015. A monthly average was computed using daily observations for the studied period. To evaluate the effects of clouds in agricultural areas, we used a cropland mask from the Worldwide Croplands project and divided the CCF into quarters. The results show that cloud cover affects the monitoring of croplands depending on geographic location and crop season. In the P1 period (September to November) 68}

UAVs include various configurations of unmanned aircraft, multirotor helicopters (e.g., quadcopters), and balloons/blimps of different sizes and shapes. Quadcopters and balloons fill a gap between satellites and aircraft when a stationary monitoring platform is needed for relatively long-term observation of an area. UAVs have advanced designs to carry small payloads and integrated flight control systems, giving them semiautonomous or fully autonomous flight capabilities. Miniaturized sensors are being developed/adapted for UAV payloads, including hyperspectral imagers, LIDAR, synthetic aperture radar, and thermal infrared sensors. UAVs are now used for a wide range of environmental applications, such as coastal wetland mapping, LIDAR bathymetry, flood and wildfire surveillance, tracking oil spills, urban studies, and Arctic ice investigations.}",

abstract = {Extreme and inaccessible environments are a new frontier that unmanned and remotely operated vehicles can today safely access and monitor. The Lusi mud eruption (NE Java Island, Indonesia) represents one of these harsh environments that are totally unreachable with traditional techniques. Here boiling mud is constantly spewed tens of meters in height and tall gas clouds surround the 100 m wide active crater. The crater is surrounded by a ∼600 m diameter circular zone of hot mud that prevents any approach to investigate and sample the eruption site. In order to access this active crater we designed and assembled a multipurpose drone. The Lusi drone is equipped with numerous airborne devices suitable for use on board of other multicopters. During the missions, three cameras can complete 1) video survey, 2) high resolution photogrammetry of desired and preselected polygons, and 3) thermal photogrammetry surveys with infra-red camera to locate hot fluids seepage areas or faulted zones. Crater sampling and monitoring operations can be pre-planned with a flight software, and the pilot is required only for take-off and landing. A winch allows the deployment of gas, mud and water samplers and contact thermometers to be operated with no risk for the aircraft. During the winch operations (that can be performed automatically), the aircraft hovers at a safety height until the tasks controlled by the winch-embedded processor are completed. The drone is also equipped with GPS-connected CO2 and CH4 sensors. Gridded surveys using these devices allowed obtaining 2D maps of the concentration and distribution of various gasses over the area covered by the flight path. The device is solid, stable even with significant wind, affordable, and easy to transport. The Lusi drone successfully operated during several expeditions at the ongoing active Lusi eruption site and proved to be an excellent tool to study other harsh or unreachable sites, where operations with more conventional methods are too expensive, dangerous or simply impossible.}

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, have gained increasing interest in both academia and industries. The evolution of UAV technologies, such as artificial intelligence, component miniaturization, and computer vision, has decreased their cost and increased availability for diverse applications and services. Remarkably, the integration of computer vision with UAVs provides cutting-edge technology for visual navigation, localization, and obstacle avoidance, making them capable of autonomous operations. However, their limited capacity for autonomous navigation makes them unsuitable for global positioning system (GPS)-blind environments. Recently, vision-based approaches that use cheaper and more flexible visual sensors have shown considerable advantages in UAV navigation owing to the rapid development of computer vision. Visual localization and mapping, obstacle avoidance, and path planning are essential components of visual navigation. The goal of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of vision-based UAV navigation techniques. Existing techniques have been categorized and extensively reviewed with regard to their capabilities and characteristics. Then, they are qualitatively compared in terms of various aspects. We have also discussed open issues and research challenges in the design and implementation of vision-based navigation techniques for UAVs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a complete review of computer vision algorithms and vision-based intelligent applications, that are developed in the field of the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the latest decade. During this time, the evolution of relevant technologies for UAVs; such as component miniaturization, the increase of computational capabilities, and the evolution of computer vision techniques have allowed an important advance in the development of UAVs technologies and applications. Particularly, computer vision technologies integrated in UAVs allow to develop cutting-edge technologies to cope with aerial perception difficulties; such as visual navigation algorithms, obstacle detection and avoidance and aerial decision-making. All these expert technologies have developed a wide spectrum of application for UAVs, beyond the classic military and defense purposes. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Computer Vision are common topics in expert systems, so thanks to the recent advances in perception technologies, modern intelligent applications are developed to enhance autonomous UAV positioning, or automatic algorithms to avoid aerial collisions, among others. Then, the presented survey is based on artificial perception applications that represent important advances in the latest years in the expert system field related to the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. In this paper, the most significant advances in this field are presented, able to solve fundamental technical limitations; such as visual odometry, obstacle detection, mapping and localization, et cetera. Besides, they have been analyzed based on their capabilities and potential utility. Moreover, the applications and UAVs are divided and categorized according to different criteria.}

abstract = {A nonlinear vision-based guidance law is presented in this paper for a missile-target scenario in the presence of model uncertainty and unknown target evasive maneuvers. To this end, projective geometric relationships are utilized to combine the image kinematics with the missile dynamics in an integrated visual dynamic system. The guidance law is designed using an image-based visual servo control method in conjunction with a sliding-mode control strategy, which is shown to achieve asymptotic target interception in the presence of the aforementioned uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is presented to prove the theoretical result, and numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust controller for both stationary and non-stationary targets.}

abstract = {During April–May 2010 volcanic ash clouds from the Icelandic Eyjafjallajökull volcano reached Europe causing an unprecedented disruption of the EUR/NAT region airspace. Civil aviation authorities banned all flight operations because of the threat posed by volcanic ash to modern turbine aircraft. New quantitative airborne ash mass concentration thresholds, still under discussion, were adopted for discerning regions contaminated by ash. This has implications for ash dispersal models routinely used to forecast the evolution of ash clouds. In this new context, quantitative model validation and assessment of the accuracies of current state-of-the-art models is of paramount importance. The passage of volcanic ash clouds over central Europe, a territory hosting a dense network of meteorological and air quality observatories, generated a quantity of observations unusual for volcanic clouds. From the ground, the cloud was observed by aerosol lidars, lidar ceilometers, sun photometers, other remote-sensing instruments and in-situ collectors. From the air, sondes and multiple aircraft measurements also took extremely valuable in-situ and remote-sensing measurements. These measurements constitute an excellent database for model validation. Here we validate the FALL3D ash dispersal model by comparing model results with ground and airplane-based measurements obtained during the initial 14–23 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull explosive phase. We run the model at high spatial resolution using as input hourly-averaged observed heights of the eruption column and the total grain size distribution reconstructed from field observations. Model results are then compared against remote ground-based and in-situ aircraft-based measurements, including lidar ceilometers from the German Meteorological Service, aerosol lidars and sun photometers from EARLINET and AERONET networks, and flight missions of the German DLR Falcon aircraft. We find good quantitative agreement, with an error similar to the spread in the observations (however depending on the method used to estimate mass eruption rate) for both airborne and ground mass concentration. Such verification results help us understand and constrain the accuracy and reliability of ash transport models and it is of enormous relevance for designing future operational mitigation strategies at Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers.}

abstract = {Estimates of volcanic source mass flux, currently deduced from observations of plume height, are crucial for ash dispersion models for aviation and population hazard. This study addresses the role of the atmospheric wind in determining the height at which volcanic plumes spread in the atmosphere and the relationship between source mass flux and plume height in a wind field. We present a predictive model of volcanic plumes that describes the bending over of the plume trajectory in a crosswind and show that model predictions are in accord with a dataset of historic eruptions if the profile of atmospheric wind shear is described. The wind restricts the rise height of volcanic plumes such that obtaining equivalent rise heights for a plume in a windy environment would require an order of magnitude increase in the source mass flux over a plume in a quiescent environment. Our model calculations are used to calibrate a semi-empirical relationship between the plume height and the source mass flux that explicitly includes the atmospheric wind speed. We demonstrate that the model can account for the variations in plume height observed during the first explosive phase of the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption using independently measured wind speeds and show that changes in the observed plume height are better explained by changing meteorology than abrupt changes in the source mass flux. This study shows that unless the wind is properly accounted for, estimates of the source mass flux during an explosive eruption are likely to be very significant underpredictions of the volcanic source conditions.},

ABSTRACT = {Worldwide, there is a significant increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by emergency services. They offer a lot of possibilities during rescue operations. Such a wide application for various purposes and environments causes many threats related to their use. To minimize the risks associated with conducting air operations with UAVs, the application of the SORA (Specific Operations Risk Assessment) methodology will be important. Due to its level of detail, it is a methodology adapted to civilian use. In this article, the authors’ team will try to develop guidelines and directions for adapting SORA to the requirements of the operational work of emergency services. Thus, the following article aims to present the most important risks related to conducting operations with the use of UAVs by first responders (FRs), and to show the sample risk analysis performed for this type of operation on the example of the ASSISTANCE project. The paper describes, on the one hand, possibilities offered by UAVs in crisis or disaster management and step-by-step Specific Operations Risk Assessment (SORA), and on the other hand, presents possible threats, consequences and methods of their mitigation during FR missions.},
